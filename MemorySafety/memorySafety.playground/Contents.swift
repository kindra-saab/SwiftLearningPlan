//Swift manages memory automatically, most of the time you don’t have to think about accessing memory at all. However, it’s important to understand where potential conflicts can occur, so you can avoid writing code that has conflicting access to memory. If your code does contain conflicts, you’ll get a compile-time or runtime error.


//A conflicting access to memory can occur when different parts of your code are trying to access the same location in memory at the same time. Multiple accesses to a location in memory at the same time can produce unpredictable or inconsistent behavior.
