//Extension is like adding more functionality to the prewritten things

// Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type

//As we know, "Double" is a class written by Apple Developers, Now we don't have access to pre-written Double Class, so to add functionality in pre-written class, we use extensions.

//This includes the ability to extend types for which you donâ€™t have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling)
