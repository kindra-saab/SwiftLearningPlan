//Extension is like adding more functionality to the prewritten things

// Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type

//As we know, "Double" is a class written by Apple Developers, Now we don't have access to pre-written Double Class, so to add functionality in pre-written class, we use extensions.

//This includes the ability to extend types for which you donâ€™t have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling)

extension Double {
    
    func convertToFahrenheit()-> Double {
        
        return ( ( self*1.8 ) + 32 )   //Here self is like "This" keyword
    }
    
    func convertToCelsius() -> Double {
        
        return ( (self - 32) / 1.8)
        
    }
    
}


var celsiusTemp:Double = 23

var fahrenTemp:Double = 74


print("Celsius to fahrenheit is \(celsiusTemp.convertToFahrenheit().rounded())")

extension Double {
    var km: Double { return self * 1_000.0 }
    var m: Double { return self }
    var cm: Double { return self / 100.0 }
    var mm: Double { return self / 1_000.0 }
    var ft: Double { return self / 3.28084 }
}
let oneInch = 25.4.mm
print("One inch is \(oneInch) meters")
// Prints "One inch is 0.0254 meters"
let threeFeet = 3.ft
print("Three feet is \(threeFeet) meters")
// Prints "Three feet is 0.914399970739201 meters"


//Extensions can add new convenience initializers to the class, but they can't add new designated initializers or deInitializers to a class.
