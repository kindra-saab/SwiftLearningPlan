//Structures and enumerations are value types. By default, the properties of a value type canâ€™t be modified from within its instance methods.

//By default , we cannot change the properties of structs/enumerations with instance methods,
//But if we want, we want to make that methods which changes the properties as "mutating"

// Prints "The point is now at (3.0, 4.0)"


// we can shorten the above mutating function,

//struct pt {
//    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
//    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
//        self = pt(x: x + deltaX, y: y + deltaY)
//    }
//}


//Type Methods.

//Instance methods are what we called on instance of class.
//We can define methods that are called on type itself, these are called type methods.

//we write type methods, using static keyword.

    //This is the method of class but not of any instance.
