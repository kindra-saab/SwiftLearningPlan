// A deInitializer is called immediately before a class instance is De-Allocated.

//Swift automatically deallocates your instances when theyâ€™re no longer needed, to free up resources.

//Classes can have atmost one DeInitialzer.


//DeInitializers are called automatically , just before the instance deAllocation takes place.

//SuperClass DeInitializer calls automatically,at the end of subclass deInitialization implementation.
